        This app simply registers pre-defined URLs for android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED
        and broadcasts its own intent with the serial number of the tag.


        Main use case is recycling read-only RFID/NFC tags for the use with Home Assistant.


        See the project website for more info.
